## Study Info

The German Internet Panel (GIP) is a longitudinal panel survey of the Collaborative Research Center SFB 884 "Political Economy of Reforms".

As a SFB 884 infrastructure project, the GIP collects data on individual attitudes and preferences relevant in political and economic decision-making processes. The data obtained provide the empirical basis for the scientific research of the SFB projects. All GIP survey data are made available to the scientific community via the GESIS Data Archive for the Social Sciences as scientific use files.

The topics covered in the GIP are divers and include attitudes towards the reform policies, the welfare state, German and EU politics, health, social inequality, education, employment and key socio-demographic information. Questionnaire modules on these topics are developed by SFB 884 researchers in collaboration with the GIP team. GIP online questionnaires of 20-25 minutes are implemented bi-monthly.

## Method

- Data collector: GIP team, SFB 884, University of Mannheim

- Population: Persons living in private households in Germany and aged 16-75 at the time of recruitment.

- Sampling method: All GIP samples are multi-stage random samples which are regionally clustered. The 2012 and 2014 samples are additionally clustered in households.

- Recruitment method: The 2012 and 2014 samples were recruited with face-to-face interviews during which respondents were invited to the online panel. Sampled persons without access to the internet were provided with the necessary equipment, internet, and support. The 2018 sample was recruited via postal invitations.

- Sample sizes and response rates: An overview of all sample sizes and response rates can be found [here](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/media/Einrichtungen/gip/Response_Rates/German_Internet_Panel_Response_Rates.pdf).

- Incentives: For their participation GIP panel members receive 4€ per completed questionnaire as well as a bonus of 5€ for completing five or 10€ for all six waves within a year. Incentives are paid out twice a year and panel members can choose whether to receive their incentives via bank transfer, as an online voucher or whether to donate it to charity. In addition, several SFB-projects incentivize panel members in various different ways.
