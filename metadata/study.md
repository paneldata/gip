## Study Info
The German Internet Panel (GIP) is a long-term study conducted by the University of Mannheim.
The GIP collects data on individual attitudes and preferences relevant in political and economic decision-making processes. All GIP survey data are made available to the scientific community via the GESIS Data Archive for the Social Sciences as scientific use files.
The topics covered in the GIP are divers and include attitudes towards the reform policies, the welfare state, German and EU politics, health, social inequality, education, employment and key socio-demographic information. Questionnaire modules on these topics are developed by researchers in collaboration with the GIP team. GIP online questionnaires of 20-25 minutes are implemented bi-monthly.
The GIP study was set up and directed from 2012 to 2022 by Prof. Dr. Blom, Professor of Data Science at the Faculty of Social Sciences, and was the central infrastructure project of the Collaborative Research Center (SFB) 884 "Political Economy of Reforms", funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) from 2010 to 2022. Since 2023, it has been based as an infrastructure project at the Mannheim University Library and is being conducted by a survey team under the academic direction of Prof. Dr. Richard Traunmüller.

## Data access
The GIP data are available to the scientific community via the [GESIS Data Archive for the Social Sciences](https://dbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/GDESC2.asp?no=0109&DB=D) as scientific use files
To order the scientific use files please proceed as described in the following document: [GIP Data Access Manual](https://dbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/download.asp?db=D&id=54805).

## Method
- Data collector: GIP team, University of Mannheim  
- Population: Persons living in private households in Germany and aged 16-75 at the time of recruitment.
- Sampling method: All GIP samples are multi-stage random samples which are regionally clustered. The 2012 and 2014 samples are additionally clustered in households.
- Recruitment method: The 2012 and 2014 samples were recruited with face-to-face interviews during which respondents were invited to the online panel. Sampled persons without access to the internet were provided with the necessary equipment, internet, and support. The 2018 sample was recruited via postal invitations.
- Sample sizes and response rates: An overview of all sample sizes and response rates can be found in the following document: [GIP Response Rates](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/media/Einrichtungen/gip/Response_Rates/German_Internet_Panel_Response_Rates.pdf).
- Incentives: For their participation GIP panel members receive up to 5€ per completed questionnaire. The incentive is staggered according to the length of the questionnaire. Panel members receive a bonus of 10€ once a year for completing all six surveys within the year or 5€ for completing at least five surveys. Until May 2024 (wave 71), the incentive was not staggered and was a fixed amount of EUR 4€ per completed questionnaire. Incentives are paid out twice a year and panel members can choose whether to receive their incentives via bank transfer, as an online voucher or whether to donate it to charity. In addition, several SFB-projects incentivize panel members in various different ways.
